Traffic sign detection on PPM images using CNN

### Step 1
a. Download the training dataset
b. Since the ppm images are not the best to visualize convert the .ppm images into .jpeg
c. Since we need to detect Red Round objects remove images which do not belong to the classes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16 , 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]
